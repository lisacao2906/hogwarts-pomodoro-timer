# Hogwarts-themed Pomodoro Timer 
This web application - hosted on a local server - is a classic Pomodoro Timer that informs you when to take a 25 minutes study session and 5 minutes break session. In addition to that, it pulls a randomly generated spell from Harry Potter. Any Harry Potter fan is sure to fall in love with this web app!

Understanding that studying can sometimes be stressful, I integrated the timer with something that I love: Harry Potter. The web app's background makes it feel like one is  studying at Hogwarts, creating an enjoyable and relaxing learning session. Enjoy!
